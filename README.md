# AirBnB Clone - The Console
Welcome to the ALX School Project - __AirBnB Clone__ (Stage 1) Repository!

This repository represents the initial phase of our ALX School project, where we aim to create a simplified version of AirBnB. The objective is to apply essential principles of higher-level programming, paving the way for the eventual development of a comprehensive web application - The AirBnB Clone.

## The Console - Command Line Interpreter
During this initial stage, we have implemented a console, serving as a command-line interpreter. This console's interface is like that of the Unix/Linus command line shell but with limited specific use cases. It is designed to efficiently manage the various objects within the website. As we progress through the project, the console will play a crucial role in shaping the functionality and features of our ultimate AirBnB Clone.

### Functionalities of the console:
- Create data model
- Manage object
    - Create new object
    - Udate attributes of object
    - Count, compute stats of objects
    - Store with persistance and retrieve objects to and from a file, databae, etc
    - Destroy objects

## How to start it
- First clone this repository to get a copy of the project on your local machine.  
    > $ git clone "_link to this repo_."
- Move into the repo's directory  
    > $ cd AirBnB_clone
- Make sure the ***console.py*** file is executable  
    > $ chmod u+x console.py
- Then execute the file  
    > $ ./console.py

## How to use it
The console can be used in ***interactive mode*** by starting it as above and the passing implemented  commands to it  
Example:  
> $ ./console.py  
> (hbnb)  
> (hbnb) help
>
> Documented commands (type help <topic>):  
========================================  
> EOF  help  quit  
>
> (hbnb)  
> (hbnb)  
> (hbnb) quit  
> $

It can also be used in ***non-interactive mode***  
> $ echo "help" | ./console.py  
> (hbnb)  
>
> Documented commands (type help <topic>):  
========================================  
> EOF  help  quit  
> (hbnb)  
> $
